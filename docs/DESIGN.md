# Transcription Automation â€“ Design Document

1. Overview

This project provides an automated, fault-tolerant pipeline for transcribing audio and video files using the OpenAI Whisper CLI tool.
Users simply copy supported audio/video files into a designated project folder. Every 10 minutes a scheduled job (systemd timer or cron) scans the folder, transcribes new files, and records the outcome.

Key features:

- Hands-off transcription using Whisper (`--model base` by default)
- State tracking to prevent double-processing
- Robust logging for operations and audits
- Designed to run 24/7 on Linux servers with minimal maintenance

2. Scope & Assumptions

## In-Scope

- Environment:

  - Ubuntu/Debian-compatible Linux distributions
  - Bash 5.x or later
  - whisper CLI and ffmpeg installed and working

- Functionality:

  - Detect newly added media files every 10 minutes
  - Generate text transcripts in .txt format
  - Maintain a state file (transcriptions.tsv) with statuses: in progress, complete, or error
  - Maintain an append-only processing log (processed.log)
  - Rotate logs daily using logrotate

- Scheduling:

  - Systemd timer (preferred) or cron job every 10 minutes
